PROMPT:

I want to perform a website copy audit for a potential client to assess their current site from a strategic copywriting and brand voice perspective. The goal is to provide them with actionable, high-impact feedback on how to improve clarity, conversion, alignment, and SEO — while gently creating awareness of how much content support they might need.

Context: This is for a business called The Meetup SG. Their website is https://www.themeetupsg.com. I want to audit the site through the lens of strong messaging, user flow, brand voice clarity, and SEO strength — while also sparking thoughts like, "Wow, there's so much potential content here… how will I create all this?"

The client has given additional context: TheMeetUpSG partners with companies to design and deliver high-impact corporate events — from overseas retreats and team-building experiences to conferences, product launches, corporate dinner and dances and hybrid events. With 8+ years of experience, we’ve worked with brands including Benefit Cosmetics, ORY, Coca-Cola, and DBS to deliver seamless, brand-aligned events that drive engagement, culture, and measurable business impact. We specialise in end-to-end event management: from strategy, concept development, production, vendor management, logistics, on-site execution to post-event coordination.

What's troubling you at the moment? Check all that apply. Getting visitors but not they're not converting, Website is confusing or hard to navigate, I need to build marketing funnels (lead magnets, email nurturing etc) to drive traffic to my website
Deliverable format: Please present the findings in a structured, visually appealing HTML document (easily convertible to PDF as a single continuous page) with:

Header: "Website Copy Audit"

Branding & Logo Placement:

Add my logo (https://i.postimg.cc/xd2T9BHV/Fresh-Pages-New-Logo-Transparent.png) in two places:
Top center - small size (80px wide), center-aligned at the top of the first page above the main title, wrapped in a div with text-align: center; width: 100% and the image set to display: inline-block; width: 80px; height: auto; for proper PDF centering
Footer center - small size (max 100px wide), center-aligned as the only element in the footer (no text, just the logo)
Print/PDF Optimization (Single Continuous Page):

Copy@media print {
  @page {
    size: auto;
    margin: 0;
  }
  body {
    padding: 2rem 3rem;
    margin: 0;
  }
  * {
    page-break-inside: auto !important;
    page-break-after: auto !important;
    page-break-before: auto !important;
  }
}
This creates a single long scrolling PDF without artificial page breaks
Content flows naturally from top to bottom as one continuous document
Maintains clean padding (2rem top/bottom, 3rem left/right) throughout
